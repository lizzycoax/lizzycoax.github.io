<p>
	By Lizzy Coax.
</p>
<p>

<h1>Part 1 - How human brains form intelligence</h1>
<p>
	<i>Mind, Mercury</i>
</p>

<hr>

<h2>The 3 systems</h2>
<br>

<h3>Experiencing</h3>
<p>
	Sensory information that enters the brain is processed into more advanced information.<br>
	Changes in information are stored in memory with a consistency and time interval.<br>
	Some information adds an amount of pleasure or pain when activated which is also stored in memory.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Thinking</h3>
<p>
	Information processing is slightly influenced by predictions from memory.<br>
	This allows refinement of information processing when being used and simulating of situations when not being used.<br>
	Sleeping blocks sensory input and muscle activation to allow low level information to be simulated as well.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Acting</h3>
<p>
	Muscle activation is processed just as sensory information for processing and prediction.<br>
	The brain will then activate the muscles that it has predicted will maximize pleasure and minimize pain in the future.

<h2>The 6 senses</h2>
<p>
	Sensory information that enters the brain.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Sight</h3>
<p>
	Information about light.<br>
	There are four ranges of wavelengths and intensities of light;<br>
	high intensity around yellow and at violet with lower sensitivity,<br>
	high intensity around green,<br>
	low intensity around cyan,<br>
	and high intensity around violet.<br>
</p>
<br>

<h3>Sound</h2>
<p>
	Information about air vibrations.<br>
	The frequency ranges from 20hz to 20khz and is physically decomposed into seperate frequencies.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Touch</h2>
<p>
	Information about the body.<br>
	This includes skin pressure, skin temperature change, skin damage and internal pressure.<br>
	Skin pressure sensors are mostly concentrated around the feet, hands, genitalia, eyes, mouth and facial features.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Taste</h3>
<p>
	Information about chemicals in the mouth.<br>
	This includes sugars, salts, acids, toxic chemicals and proteins.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Smell</h3>
<p>
	Information about chemicals in the air.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Balance</h3>
<p>
	Information about the direction of gravity.
</p>
<br>

<h2>The 10 intuitions</h2>
<p>
	Information processing in the brain.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Spatial</h3>
<p>
	A sense of 3d space for visual and auditory information.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Visual</h3>
<p>
	Being able to use context to see true colors, shapes, materials etc. of things.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Facial</h3>

	Humans have a very sensitive facial recognition, allowing them to distinquish nearly any two faces, human or otherwise.
</p>
<br>

</p>
<br>

<h3>Auditory</h3>
<p>
	Distinguishing the different sounds that sound is made up of.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Bodily</h3>
<p>
	A sense of where body parts are based on balance, sight, touch and muscle activation and sensing touch at those positions.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Chemical</h3>
<p>
	Distinguishing chemicals from taste and smell.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Motoric</h3>
<p>
	Various groupings of muscle activation.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Emotional</h3>
<p>
	A reading of emotion and intention based on facial expression, pose and movement.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Physical</h3>
