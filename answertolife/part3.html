<h2>Individual consciousness</h2>
<br>

<h3>Sentience</h3>
<p>
	As humans go through their life, they gain more needs as they experience and think about desires.<br>
	This usually happens in childhood, when they have less resolve and stumble onto them.<br>
	Getting exposed to extreme fulfillment of desires gives them fetishes as well.<br>
	Since most humans have had different experiences and thoughts, their needs can differ in any situation.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Sapience</h3>
<p>
	When a baby is taken out of the womb, it is removed from the safe environment of the womb.<br>
	They are then forced to understand the world around them to survive.
</p>
<br>

<h3>Self awareness</h3>
<p>
	When the world is understood enough, humans start being aware about themselves to a progressively deeper degree.<br>
	This allows them to experience from an outside point of view, giving them more consciousness.<br>
	Since beliefs can be false, humans can experience self awareness about things that arent there.
</p>

<h2>Societal consciousness</h2>
<p>
	Modes of thinking that groups of humans progress through.
</p>
<br>

<h3>1: Autistic</h3>
<p>
	<i>Survival - Naive</i><br>
	Fulfilling their own desires.
</p>
<h3>2: Sharing</h3>
<p>
	<i>Survival - Good</i><br>
	Fulfilling the desires of others for a reward.
</p>
<h3>3: Selfish</h3>
<p>
	<i>Survival - Bad</i><br>
	Getting others to fulfill their desires without giving back.<br>
	This is good for the individual but bad for the group.
</p>
<h3>4: Traditional</h3>
<p>
	<i>Morality - Naive</i><br>
	Labeling humans as good or bad based on whether they follow rules.<br>
	Since other groups have different rules, this can label individuals from those groups as bad.
</p>
<h3>5: Modern</h3>
<p>
	<i>Morality - Good</i><br>
	Respecting the rules of other groups when interacting with them.
</p>
<h3>6: Post modern</h3>
<p>
	<i>Morality - Bad</i><br>
	Allowing individuals to follow the rules of their group in other groups.<br>
	Since groups have a reason for their rules, this can lead to a dysfunctional society.
</p>
<h3>7: Sanctifying</h3>
<p>
	<i>Spirituality - Naive</i><br>
	Seeing that other humans act differently from them.
</p>
<h3>8: Holistic</h3>
<p>
	<i>Spirituality - Good</i><br>
	Seeing that humans act the way they do due to their experiences.
</p>
<h3>9: Mindful</h3>
<p>
	<i>Spirituality - Final</i><br>
	Holding no value to experience.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Degradation of consciousness</h2>
<p>
	A process that degrades consciousness when consciousness is already low, such as when the human hasnt matured or is unaware of this process.
</p>
<br>

<h3>1: Trauma</h3>
<p>
	An event outside of a humans control that causes pain or makes them cause harm, or makes them believe that will happen.<br>
	Such events include getting tortured, seeing other humans die and discovering they have harmful desires.
</p>
<h3>2: Repression</h3>
<p>
	Avoiding anything that might cause a situation that traumatized them and not thinking about it.<br>
	Repression persists for as long as the human is unaware about what they arent thinking about.
</p>
<h3>3: Dissociation</h3>
<p>
	When humans do get in a situation that traumatized them they have no control over themselves since they havent processed the situation.<br>
	If the situation they dissociate from is long term, such as abusive childhoods, seperated selves can develop.
</p>
<h3>4: Addiction</h3>
<p>
	Repression can cause humans to not think about the desires that get them into harmful situations.<br>
	This along with dissociation further enforces their idea that they have no control over themselves, causing a cycle of addiction.
</p>
<h3>5: Depression</h3>
<p>
	When humans repress enough of their desires they can become unable to see happiness.
</p>
<h3>6: Suicide</h3>
<p>
	When depression gets strong enough, humans can see only pain in the future.<br>
	Since nothing is better than pain, killing themselves becomes a better alternative.
</p>
<br>

<h2>Autism & ADHD</h2>
<br>

<h3>1: Situational unawareness</h3>
<p>
	Autists have less emotional intuition compared to others.
</p>
<h3>2: Adaption</h3>
<p>
	Autists more often need to process emotions as opposed to having an intuition about them already.
</p>
<h3>3: Overstimulation</h3>
<p>
	When too much information enters the brain that has not been adapted to, it can make humans not able to respond correctly.
</p>
<h3>4: Avoidance</h3>
<p>
	Humans avoid situations in which they get overstimulated.<br>
	For autists this typically includes eye contact, confrontations and groups.
</p>
<h3>5: Lack of relation</h3>
<p>
	Avoidance of being close to others can cause a lack of relation to them.
</p>
<h3>6: Unfit beliefs</h3>
<p>
	Many beliefs that society has are based on humans being able to handle certain situations and relating to eachother.<br>
	When a human has those beliefs but does not have the qualities it is based on, it can make following its rules less fulfilling than believed.
</p>
<h3>7: Attention defecit</h3>
<p>
	A task that is believed to be more fulfilling than it actually is can cause dissociation to occur, causing the task to be abandoned.
</p>
<h3>8: Hyperfixation</h3>
<p>
	Tasks that fall outside of unfulfilling beliefs can seem much more fulfilling compared to other tasks.
